# **FightCOVIDNepal**

This applicaton is built using ReactJS. It is a COVID19 symptom reporting application. Users may use this application to report their symptomps as well a medium to find out COVID-prone areas in Nepal

- GCP (Google Cloud Platform) was used to host the application using Firebase hosting
- Google Maps API and Geolocation API are used for rendering the map and geolocation respectively
- Google Firebase is used to store user database
- ChatbotUI is leveraged to collect user input to make it more interactive instead of using tradition long forms
- The user's location (should they chose to share) gets plotted in the map using green dots as a measure of the spread within an area
- The calculated risk factor is also communicated with the user and they get to decide wether to add their data to the map or not

# To run this application:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
